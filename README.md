## Project Description

### Project 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is performed on a medical appointment records dataset, with the aim of determining the characteristics about the patient that are correlated with 
the no-show rate. To achieve the aim of this project, the following questions are explored.

- Do patients that make appointments much earlier tend to show up less often?
- Do patients that receive SMS reminder(s) tend to show up more often?
- Which gender shows up more often?
- Does age affect no-show rate?
- Does scholarship affect no-show rate?

### Project 2 - A/B Test
Results of A/B test run by an e-commerce website are analyzed. The aim of this project is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, 
or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Project 3 - Data Wrangling
Data wrangling is performed on a dog ratings dataset. Data wrangling consists of three steps - gathering, assessing and cleaning. Data is gathered from three different sources, 
which include files on local device and servers. Subsequently, data is assessed with visual and programmatic assessments to look for data quality and tidiness issues. Finally, 
the data is cleaned based on the issues found in assessment.

### Project 4 - Data Visualization
Data visualization and wrangling is performed on a loan dataset, with the aim of finding out features that are useful in predicting the loan's outcome status via 
analysis and visualization. Summary of findings can be found [here](https://github.com/KCKhoo/data-analysis-projects-udacity/tree/main/4_Data_Visualization).
